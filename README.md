# PY-mini-projects

A collection of Python mini projects and small programs for practice and demonstration purposes.

## Project Overview

This repository contains several independent Python scripts, each showcasing different programming techniques and logic:

- **1_funny_sentence_generator.py**: Generates random funny sentences by combining words in creative ways.

- **2_calculator_with_history.py**: A simple calculator application with history tracking that saves calculation records to a file for later reference.

- **3_magic_word.py**: An interactive game/guessing script involving a 'magic word' concept where users attempt to find the hidden word.

- **4_rent_calculator.py**: A rent calculation utility that computes rental costs based on user inputs like duration and property specifications.

- **5_rock_paper_scissor.py**: Classic rock-paper-scissors game implementation for playing against the computer with random AI moves.

- **6_tic_tac_toe.py**: A tic-tac-toe game with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter, allowing interactive gameplay.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3
- **GUI Framework:** Tkinter (for tic-tac-toe game)
- **Logic Used:**
  - String manipulation (sentence generation)
  - Basic arithmetic operations (calculator, rent calculator)
  - File I/O (history storage)
  - Game logic and state management
  - Random number generation (games)
  - GUI development with Tkinter
  - Interactive console input-output
  - Control flow (conditional statements, loops)

## Usage

Each Python script runs independently. Clone the repository and execute scripts using Python 3:

```bash
python3 script_name.py
```

For example:
- Funny sentence generator: `python3 1_funny_sentence_generator.py`
- Calculator with history: `python3 2_calculator_with_history.py`
- Magic word game: `python3 3_magic_word.py`
- Rent calculator: `python3 4_rent_calculator.py`
- Rock-paper-scissors: `python3 5_rock_paper_scissor.py`
- Tic-tac-toe (GUI): `python3 6_tic_tac_toe.py`
