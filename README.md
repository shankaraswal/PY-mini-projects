# PY-mini-projects

A collection of Python mini projects and small programs for practice and demonstration purposes.

## Project Overview

This repository contains several independent Python scripts, each showcasing different programming techniques and logic:

- **1_funny_sentence_generator.py**: Generates random funny sentences.
- **2_calculator_with_history.py**: Simple calculator with history tracking.
- **3_magic_word.py**: Interactive script involving a 'magic word' concept (game or guessing logic).
- **4_rent_calculator.py**: Rent calculation utility based on user input.
- **calc_history.txt**: Stores calculation histories from the calculator project.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Logic Used:**
  - String manipulation (sentence generation)
  - Basic arithmetic operations (calculator, rent calculator)
  - File I/O (history storage)
  - Simple interactive/console input-output
  - Control flow (conditional statements, loops)

## Usage

Each Python script runs independently. Clone the repository and execute scripts using Python 3:

```bash
python3 script_name.py
```
